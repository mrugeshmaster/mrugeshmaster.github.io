I am a SJSU Spring 2020 Graduate Student pursuing Software Engineering with **3.57 GPA**.
I am seeking On-Campus and Winter 2021 Internship jobs with knowledge of Design Patterns in Java, Object Detection (YOLOv3, OpenCV), Agile Methodologies (Scrum, Kanban), Docker and Git

I have previously worked in a client-facing role for requirements gathering and as an ETL Developer with clear concepts of data warehousing. With 3 years of experience, I trained 10+ employees in SAP Data Services, SAP Business Objects, Web Intelligence and Crystal Reports. I have acted as Business Objects administrator with duties such as managing access rights, promotion management and system maintenance between Production, Development and Testing Environments.

During my undergrad study in India, I acted as Training and Placement Student Coordinator. I mentored fellow students for interview prep and served as a liaison between students and recruiters to ease the hiring process
